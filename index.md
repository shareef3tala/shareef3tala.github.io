## What are System Prompts?

System prompts are specific inputs that guide the behavior of language models. They play a crucial role in determining the output generated by these models. By analyzing these prompts, users can better understand the models' capabilities and limitations. This repository serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in the mechanics of LLMs.

## Collection Details

The **Leaked System Prompts** repository includes a variety of prompts, categorized based on their application and context. Each prompt is sourced from different LLMs and aims to showcase unique aspects of model behavior.

### Categories

1. **Conversational Prompts**: These prompts are designed to facilitate dialogue and maintain context in conversations.
2. **Instructional Prompts**: These prompts guide the model to perform specific tasks or answer questions.
3. **Creative Prompts**: These prompts encourage the model to generate creative content, such as stories or poems.
4. **Technical Prompts**: These prompts focus on technical topics, providing insights into how models handle specialized knowledge.
